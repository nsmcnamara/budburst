#### Setup ####
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(ncdf4)


#### Data Import ####
# get coordinates of provenance sites (id, long, lat)
df_mother_info <- read.csv("~/budburst/data/processed/mother-info.csv") 

summary(df_mother_info)
sapply(df_mother_info, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# get unique coordinates
unique_coordinates <- df_mother_info %>%
  distinct(longitude, latitude, .keep_all = FALSE)

# get bioclim data
# 152 files following the pattern /Users/simonemcnamara/budburst/data/ISIMIP3a/CHELSA-W5E5v1.0/chelsa-w5e5v1.0_obsclim_tas_1800arcsec_global_daily_201003.nc
# the 152 files cover the years 1979 - 2016, and for each year the months January until April
# each file has daily mean temperatures for each day of the month
# the temperatures are recorded in Kelvin

files <- list.files(path = "data/ISIMIP3a/CHELSA-W5E5v1.0", full.names = TRUE)

stack <- stack(files) 

# create a df that has an entry with growing degree days from january until april for each year in the dataset (1979 - 2016)
# where growing degree days is the cumulative temperature above 5Â°C, and temperatures below that are discarded and not considered when calculating the growing degree days

# Set the base temperature in Kelvin
Tbase <- 278.15
